## Implementation Details

### Environment Setup

```python
# Python Version: 3.8+
# Key Dependencies
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
pathlib==1.0.1
```

### API Authentication

- AssemblyAI: Bearer token in headers
- Deepgram: API Key in headers
- Gladia: API Key in headers

### Implementation Approach

1. **AssemblyAI Implementation**:

```python
# Two-step process
def transcribe_assemblyai(audio_file):
    # 1. Upload
    upload_url = upload_to_assemblyai(audio_file)

    # 2. Transcribe
    transcript_id = request_transcription(upload_url)

    # 3. Poll for results
    while True:
        result = check_transcription_status(transcript_id)
        if result['status'] == 'completed':
            return result
        time.sleep(1)
```

2. **Deepgram Implementation**:

```python
# Single-step process
def transcribe_deepgram(audio_file):
    with open(audio_file, 'rb') as audio:
        response = requests.post(
            'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen',
            headers={
                'Authorization': f'Token {api_key}'
            },
            data=audio
        )
    return response.json()
```

3. **Gladia Implementation**:

```python
# Single-step process with multipart upload
def transcribe_gladia(audio_file):
    with open(audio_file, 'rb') as audio:
        files = {'audio': audio}
        response = requests.post(
            'https://api.gladia.io/audio/text/audio-transcription',
            headers={'x-gladia-key': api_key},
            files=files
        )
    return response.json()
```

### Error Handling

- Implemented try-catch blocks for each service
- Specific error handling for:
  - Network errors
  - API rate limits
  - Invalid audio formats
  - Authentication failures
  - Timeout handling

### Response Processing

- Each service returns different JSON structures
- Standardized response format:

```python
{
    "transcript": str,
    "confidence": float,
    "processing_time": float,
    "success": bool
}
```

### Overview

- Used Gradio for creating a user-friendly web interface
- Allows direct audio file uploads and real-time transcription
- Displays results from all three services simultaneously

### Implementation Details

1. **Gradio Interface Setup**:

```python
import gradio as gr

def process_audio(audio_file):
    """Process audio through all three services and return formatted results"""
    results = {
        "deepgram": {"status": "❌ Failed"},
        "assemblyai": {"status": "❌ Failed"},
        "gladia": {"status": "❌ Failed"}
    }

    try:
        # Process with Deepgram
        deepgram_result = transcribe_deepgram(audio_file)
        results["deepgram"] = {
            "status": "✅ Success",
            "transcript": deepgram_result["text"],
            "confidence": f"{deepgram_result['confidence']:.2%}"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        results["deepgram"]["error"] = str(e)

    # Similar blocks for AssemblyAI and Gladia
    # ...

    return format_results_as_markdown(results)

# Create Gradio interface
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# Speech-to-Text Service Comparison")

    with gr.Row():
        audio_input = gr.Audio(type="filepath")
        text_output = gr.Markdown()

    audio_input.change(
        fn=process_audio,
        inputs=[audio_input],
        outputs=[text_output]
    )

# Launch the interface
demo.launch(share=False)
```
